//! The C-ABI seam between the remaining Flash kernel and the Rust modules.
//!
//! Every function here exists only because two languages currently share one
//! kernel image. Flash cannot see Rust slices, so each entry point takes an
//! explicit pointer/length pair, and each is re-wrapped on the Flash side into
//! the slice-shaped signature its callers already use. When a Flash caller ports,
//! its shim here goes with it; when the last one ports, this module is deleted.
//!
//! Rules for anything added here: `extern "C"`, `#[no_mangle]`, no panic may
//! cross the boundary, and no Rust type without a fixed representation.
